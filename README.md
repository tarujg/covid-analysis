## Motivation
It’s clear that the outbreak of COVID-19 changed people’s lives everywhere especially in social and economic aspects. People prefer to stay at home rather than go out. Online shoppings becomes more popular but real stores encounter slumps. We would like to find the changes before and after COVID-19 in different aspects and the correlations between them.
